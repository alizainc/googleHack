Google Maps Hackathon (Storm the Road Hackathon)

•	Diverse group project. Four members, 1 CS, 1 IE, 1 Business and myself CmpE majors.
•	Develop, design and execute a product idea that would merge the Google Maps APIs and the Weather Channel APIs.
•	Our project was based on the principle of S4: Service, Safety, Story-telling and Science.
•	We built a web user interface, named Triage, where people stuck in storm could pin-point on the Google Map for help by giving brief information like special needs, number of people with them and resources available. This information will be sent to local authorities, Red Cross, CDC and any other life-rescue government agencies.
•	The web interface would also give severeness and safety information for the next 48 hours. It also displayed other help resources such as Red Cross and CDC emergency shelters.
